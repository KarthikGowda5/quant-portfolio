# Quant Research Portfolio

A reproducible, research-oriented portfolio focused on time-series modeling, execution-aware backtesting, and risk analysis. Designed to demonstrate practical skills relevant to quant trading, quantitative research, and risk analytics roles.

## Overview

This repository contains a structured sequence of quantitative finance projects covering:

- Market microstructure research
- Market making and liquidity provision
- Execution cost analysis
